# Generate Product Requirements Document (PRD) for Linear

Generate a comprehensive PRD following our established pattern. I'll help you create a detailed product specification document.

## Information I Need

Please provide the following details:

1. **Product/Feature Name**: What are we building?
2. **Problem Statement**: What problem does this solve? Who has this problem?
3. **Target Users**: Who will use this? (primary and secondary personas)
4. **Key Features**: Main functionality (3-5 features with descriptions)
5. **Success Metrics**: How do we measure success? (KPIs and targets)
6. **Technical Constraints**: Any technical limitations or requirements?
7. **Timeline**: Rough timeline expectations or phases
8. **Risks**: Main risks to consider
9. **Competitive Context**: How do competitors handle this?

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| $RISK_1 | $H_M_L | $H_M_L | $MITIGATION_STRATEGY |
| $RISK_2 | $H_M_L | $H_M_L | $MITIGATION_STRATEGY |

## Open Questions

```

## What I'll Do

Based on your input, I will:

1. Format the title as `[PRD] {Product/Feature Name}`
2. Create a comprehensive executive summary
3. Clearly articulate the problem and its impact
4. Define the solution with specific features
5. Set measurable success criteria
6. Establish clear scope boundaries
7. Include technical and UX requirements
8. Create a phased implementation timeline
9. Identify and mitigate key risks

Please provide the information above, and I'll generate a complete PRD ready for Linear!
